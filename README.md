# fMRI Motion Artifact Suppression
Tools for evaluating the efficacy of motion artifact suppression strategies

Accompanies "Pitfalls and recommended strategies and metrics for suppressing motion artifacts in functional MRI" by Raval et al., currently under journal review. 

## Usage
Please see `requirements.txt` for a list of Python dependencies. An example of computing QC metrics on a processed fMRI dataset can be found in the `example.ipynb` notebook. 

(If the notebook does not open correctly in the browser, please download and open in Jupyter or use the `example.py` file instead.)
