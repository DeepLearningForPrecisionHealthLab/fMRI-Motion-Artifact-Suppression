# fMRI Motion Artifact Suppression
Tools for evaluating the efficacy of motion artifact suppression strategies

Accompanies Raval et al. ["Pitfalls and recommended strategies and metrics for suppressing motion artifacts in functional MRI"](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12021-022-09565-8), Neuroinformatics (2022).

## Usage
Please see `requirements.txt` for a list of Python dependencies. An example of computing QC metrics on a processed fMRI dataset can be found in the `example.ipynb` notebook. 

(If the notebook does not open correctly in the browser, please download and open in Jupyter or use the `example.py` file instead.)
